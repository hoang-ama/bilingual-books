Information

Step 1: Find the source text
The program will break each line by full stops rather than paragraphs or other punctionation so keep that in mind. Click here to copy the first page of Harry Potter to show how to formated correctly and to demonstrate the generator

Step 2: Select Source and Target Languages
Find the text areas labeled "Enter the code of your source language" and "Enter the code of your target language." In the first text area, enter the language code of the source language (e.g., "fr" for French). In the second text area, enter the language code of the target language (e.g., "en" for English).

Step 3: Input Source Text
Below the language code text areas, there is a text area labeled "Enter source text." Type or paste the source text you want to translate and generate a bilingual book from.

Step 4: Generate Bilingual Book
Click the "Generate Book" button to start the translation and book generation process.

Step 5: Wait for Translation
The application will begin translating the source text paragraph by paragraph into the target language. Each paragraph will display the original source text on the left and the translated text on the right.

Step 6: View Bilingual Book
As the application processes the paragraphs, a bilingual book will be generated on the screen. The left side of each paragraph will show the source text in the source language, and the right side will display the translated text in the target language.

Step 7: Download the Epub
There will be a button to download the Epub that will appear 5 seconds after the book is done generating

Step 8: Save as PDF
Once the bilingual book is fully generated and displayed on the screen, press Ctrl + P (Windows) or Command + P (Mac) to open the print dialog.

In the print dialog, select the printer as "Save as PDF" or a similar option.

Adjust any print settings you desire, such as page orientation, margins, and more. I suggest setting margins to 0

Click the "Save" or "Print" button to save the bilingual book as a PDF file on your computer.
